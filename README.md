Lara: Laravel project generator
===============================

Laravel is my favorite PHP framework. It has a great bundle called
[Bob](http://bundles.laravel.com/bundle/bob) used to generate code
(controllers, models, etc) from the command line in a similar way to
[fire](https://github.com/AzizLight/fire). However, it lacks a tool to
generate new projects. That's where Lara comes in.
